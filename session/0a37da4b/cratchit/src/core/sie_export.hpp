// for Fortnox must hold only the vouchers Fortnox does not have yet: vouchers
// are matched on date and counted postings, not series and number (Fortnox
// renumbers), and any voucher of the file that cratchit lacks or holds
// otherwise stops the export, as Fortnox could not take the change. "Allt" is
// not for Fortnox: importing it would double every voucher Fortnox has.
