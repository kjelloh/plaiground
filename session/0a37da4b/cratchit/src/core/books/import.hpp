// Plans importing a parsed SIE 4E file (see sie::check_document for the file's own

//
// - Identity: the first import (no orgnr yet) sets the organisation number and
//   name from #ORGNR and #FNAMN. Later, a different orgnr or name is an error.
// - Fiscal year: a new year must not overlap a year in the books; a year with
//   the same start must have the same end.
// - Vouchers: the file is the truth of its year 0. One already in the books (same
//   series and number) is skipped when it means the same: a row dated as its
//   voucher counts as having no date, a zero quantity as none (Fortnox writes
//   them so). It is taken from the file (and
//   noted) when only history is added: the same registration and signature (the
//   date and text may be edited), each row of the books in its place unchanged or
//   struck (#BTRANS), a struck row still struck, and any further rows added
//   (#RTRANS). With forcing, a voucher that differs otherwise and was imported, in
//   an open year, is taken from the file (see Forcing). The rest of the year's
//   vouchers make the file the truth (see ImportPlan::reverts), in this order:
//   a voucher in the books with the same date and counted postings (account and
//   amount) as a voucher of the file is the same voucher under another name, the
//   file's replaces it (renamed; the same text first, then the lowest number);
//   one with the same series and number as a voucher of the file is replaced by
//   it; of those left, a voucher with the same date as another and its counted
//   postings turned (a correction and what it corrects; not a credit note on
//   another day) is dropped with it; the others become
//   waiting events with their counted postings (demoted), noted on their
//   registration day. The file's other vouchers are added. Any change in a
//   closed year is an error. Each voucher the file puts in place (added,
//   renamed or replaced) takes one waiting event with the same date and
//   counted postings off the year's waiting list (waiting_booked).
//   Row dates the file is silent about are kept: a row of a voucher the file
//   puts in place (or leaves as it is) that has no date in the file takes the
//   date of a row of the books' voucher with the same account and amount, when
//   that date is the row's own (not its voucher's date), e.g. a bank's date from
//   a statement entry. A date the file gives wins. Each kept date is noted.
// - Accounts, dimensions, objects and company details: new ones are added;
//   changes are taken (and noted) only from a file whose year is the latest in
//   the books, so an older file does not undo newer names.
// - Balances are cratchit's own: a year directly after another opens with its
//   closing balances. The file's opening and closing balances (#IB, #UB, #RES,
//   also of earlier years in the books) are only checked; each difference is
//   noted with the vouchers that may explain it (those with that amount on the
//   account), and so is any opening balance the import changes in other years.
