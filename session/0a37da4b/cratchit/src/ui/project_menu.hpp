// read). Its options are the fiscal years (see list_years_until with today):
// the current year (the one today is in) as 0 and the older ones as 1, 2, ...
// up to 9, like #RAR 0, -1, -2 in SIE without the minus, back to the oldest
// in the books. A year not booked yet is listed too, so a new year shows when
// it begins. Each tells what is booked: "bokfört: inget" or "bokfört: 37
// verifikationer". Each leads to its year (see
// fiscal_year_menu.hpp). The years are read again when the user comes back.
// No input. Reached by a digit from the workspace.
