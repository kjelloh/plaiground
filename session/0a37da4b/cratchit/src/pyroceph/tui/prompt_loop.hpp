//
// Typing input: printable keys go into the input and are echoed. Backspace
// and Delete erase one; when the input becomes empty, navigating starts
// again. Esc and Ctrl-U empty the input and navigating starts again. Tab adds
// what the state completes the input with, or lists the candidates and writes
// the input again below them. Enter gives the input to the state's on_input:
// when accepted, the reply is shown, the input is emptied, and the state it
// leads to (if any) becomes current, else the state named by its back_to (if
// any); then the current state is shown. When
// not, the error text is shown and the input is kept, so the user can correct it.

// that has wrapped onto more rows. Without it Backspace assumes one row.
