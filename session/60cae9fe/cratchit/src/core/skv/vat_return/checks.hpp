// The findings of the period, from every fiscal year of the books, counted postings only:
// 1. Not fully booked: waiting events and statement entries not yet booked (open_entries) dated in the period.
// 2. The VAT clearing accounts (2650, 1650) posted in a voucher whose other rows are not all on VAT accounts,
//    the tax account (1630), the rounding account (3740) or memo accounts (9000-9999): only a clearing or a
//    charge voucher posts them.
// 3. Reverse charge and import in pairs, per voucher: a purchase base (boxes 20-24, or 50) needs output VAT
//    (boxes 30-32, or 60-62) and the other way round; with one output VAT box its amount must be the base
//    times its rate, rounded towards zero to whole öre; and box 48 must deduct that output VAT in full.
// 4. A voucher on an account of a box, dated in the period, registered after the period's clearing voucher
//    (a voucher by rule 2 with rows on VAT accounts): the return made then lacks it.
// 5. Postings on accounts 2600-2699 that report in no box (2650 aside).
