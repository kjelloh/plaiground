# Progress

## Now

Task 1: CMake + Conan scaffold in `cratchit/`. Done.

Task 2: Single-key REPL (`h` help, `q` / Ctrl-D quit). Builds without warnings, 8 tests pass, verified in a pty and with piped input. In review.

Task 3: Seeded user manual `cratchit/MANUAL.md`; CLAUDE.md now requires keeping it current. In review.

Task 4: `h` browses the built-in manual (`core/manual`, `core/help`). Number keys drill down, `-` goes back,
`q` leaves help, Esc does nothing, 0/9 scroll lists of more than 9, long output pages like `more`.
39 tests pass, no warnings, checked with piped input and in a 10-row pty. Not built on Windows yet. In review.

## Next

To be given in chat.

## Agreed in chat

- 2026-10-19: Tasks are given in chat, not in files. Conventions, architecture and domain knowledge live in the code the user approves, not in separate docs.
- 2026-10-19: Implement natively, or consume from Conan when appropriate.
- 2026-10-19: Targets: `cratchit_core` library (all logic) + thin `cratchit` executable + `cratchit_tests` (GoogleTest via Conan).
- 2026-10-19: Classic headers (`#pragma once`), no C++20 modules.
- 2026-10-20: Single-key input is plain code (termios / conio), not a Conan package. `q` quits.
- 2026-10-20: User manual lives in `cratchit/MANUAL.md`; every new or changed user operation updates it.
- 2026-10-20: Help is MANUAL.md built into the binary. Headings are the menu. `-` backs out (not Esc, which
  arrow keys also send). `q` in help leaves help only. Over 9 entries: 1-8 plus `0 ...up` / `9 ...down`.
  Long output pages with space/Enter at `--More--`.

## Open questions

- Should warnings be errors (`-Werror` / `/WX`)? Currently not.
- Is a CI setup (e.g. GitHub Actions on macOS/Linux/Windows) wanted to verify cross-platform builds?
